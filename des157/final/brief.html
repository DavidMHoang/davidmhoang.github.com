                    The project topic will be improving the "Every Picture" <br>
                    studio project. <br>
                    <br>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.producedbynri.com/">NIGHTRUNNER INTERNATIONAL</a></h2>
                    Seeing the images at the beginning in a slideshow <br>
                    in small intervals is a nice feature to capture <br>
                    a user's attention. I can see that this website's <br>
                    target audience are car fanatics and how it advertises <br>
                    their products and have a "Featured Items" section. <br>
                    <div id="image-section">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="screenshots/Nightrunner_slide.PNG" alt="night_slide" style="width:40%">
                            <figcaption>Fig.1 - NIGHTRUNNER, CAR DISPLAY SLIDE, 2021.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="screenshots/Nightrunner_feature.PNG" alt="night_slide" style="width:40%">
                            <figcaption>Fig.2 - NIGHTRUNNER, FEATURED ITEMS, 2021.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    Some of these features nice and I really like the <br>
                    images used to help describe their website. I would <br>
                    improve more on the images to be more <br>
                    interactive and eye catching than just in a small <br>
                    contained area. Overall, I would like to redesign <br>
                    my project to be simplistic as this, using <br>
                    my own images and without the use of an <br>
                    external engine and that I can use more of <br>
                    my own images to speak about who I am. <br>
                    I plan on keeping the old images, but reworking <br>
                    a newer design and add more images to it. 

                    <h2><a href="https://storybird.com/">STORYBIRD</a></h2>
                    This website, similar to the one above, also <br>
                    has a main component to capture the attention <br>
                    of users that come to the site. I really <br>
                    get capture easily by big images because <br>
                    I am curious to see what it does next <br>
                    or how it plays a part of the site. <br>
                    <div id="image-section">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="screenshots/storybird_main.PNG" alt="night_slide" style="width:60%">
                            <figcaption>Fig.3 - STORYBIRD, MAIN SLIDE, 2021.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    This website looks to be targetted towards writers. <br>
                    Knowing the target audience can really help with <br>
                    finding out what to put on a page and <br>
                    how to place components on a page to get <br>
                    users to interact with them and make it <br>
                    somewhat fun rather than it being bland. <br>
                    The different panels and the different books <br>
                    and their description is something I really <br>
                    like, an idea I would want to implement <br>
                    to my project and update accordingly. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    My goals for the project is to simulate some <br>
                    usage of a slide show component on the landing page <br>
                    and capture the user's attention right off the bat. <br>
                    Alongside that, I do want to have my images <br>
                    in a zig-zag pattern and having a brief explanation <br>
                    to what it is, and have a modal appear <br>
                    with the image and full description displayed <br>
                    after the user clicks on the box. It will <br>
                    be similar in terms of the slide and zig-zag <br>
                    idea, but it will be different with my images <br>
                    and including a modal for a temporary screen <br>
                    to display the image and full description. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                    The overall look I want to aim for is <br>
                    minimalistic with some classy dark colors. <br>
                    I want to keep the theme in black and white <br>
                    with gradient effects on the image and <br>
                    have transitional animations on some of the <br>
                    interactive components. Hovering a mouse <br>
                    over the images can also fade it into the <br>
                    next image in that category too. It can <br>
                    be multiple of the same subject and have <br>
                    a dedicated slideshow to it. This can be <br>
                    repeated for different images tiles as well. 

                    <br>

                    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                    Interacting with the images, some I wish to <br>
                    behave similarly to the sunset feature I did <br>
                    previously on my "Every Picture" Project. I <br>
                    thought it was really cool to have a mouse <br>
                    drag across a screen be the controller to <br>
                    show a change on the screen updated live. <br>
                    The modals would show as a feedback to the <br>
                    user to know that clicking an image opens <br>
                    another screen, and I might implement a <br>
                    like button for the user to let me know <br>
                    if they like the image or not. This will <br>
                    also provide feedback for me as well, <br>
                    letting me know if I can make it better <br>
                    or if this user is interested in it. 

                    <br>

                    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                    The experience for the audience is that <br>
                    I want them to know who I am and <br>
                    what my life is like and how my views <br>
                    are. I want them to know my thoughts are <br>
                    based off what they can see in an image. <br>
                    I want the audience to have a good time <br>
                    browsing around and understanding more <br>
                    about me and my lifestyle or my hobbies <br>
                    or the important aspects of my life. <br>
                    I'm not entirely sure on how I will <br>
                    achieve this, but I will work hard on <br>
                    it and develop more on top of it <br>
                    as I continue to work on it.
