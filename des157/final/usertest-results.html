                    <h2>Please test the scrolling to see if it will follow. Does it scroll and follow? Is this a good idea?</h2>
                    <p>
                        User response: I don’t see anything “following” when <br>
                        I scroll. I am not sure what I am <br>
                        supposed to be looking for. I am not sure <br>
                        if it’s a good idea or not because I <br>
                        am not sure what is supposed to be following? <br>
                        Is there supposed to be a sticky element or <br>
                        a fixed element? I like the concept of a <br>
                        website that is a cherry blossom tree with blossoms <br>
                        being the clickable elements though.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Please test tapping on an icon. Do you think this is helpful? Do you think it can be improved?</h2>
                    <p>
                        User response: When hovering over the blossom <br>
                        icons some descriptive text appear describing what <br>
                        I will see when I click. I like this as a <br>
                        way of communicating that the blossom is clickable <br>
                        but it would be nice if the blossom also <br>
                        scaled up a bit; like scale: 1.1 on hover <br>
                        would be nice to better communicate the interactivity. <br>
                        I also would have liked to see non-distorted images. <br>
                        The stretching of the photos makes them a lot <br>
                        less pleasing to look at than if they were a <br>
                        bit smaller but not stretched.

                    <h2>Please test the sound if it is working. Is the sound needed or make a difference?</h2>
                    <p>
                        User response: The sound added a nice atmospheric touch, <br>
                        but it was unclear what it’s purpose was until <br>
                        I clicked on it. Then I was like, “ah okay, <br>
                        it’s atmospheric.” Something to indicate the <br>
                        purpose of the sound to the user would have <br>
                        been nice so I could decide whether I want to <br>
                        click before I click.

                    <h2>Observation 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        The user had trouble understanding, on the website, <br>
                        what I meant by scrolling and following an element <br>
                        because I was unable to attach and element with <br>
                        the scrolling effect. Of course, the user was <br>
                        not able to tell what would be a good idea <br>
                        or not because there was nothing they could <br>
                        reference. They did ask if there was suppose <br>
                        to be a sticky element or a fixed element <br>
                        that was supposed to be followed on the scrolling <br>
                        within the window. I am glad that the user <br>
                        recognized that I was going for the cherry blossom <br>
                        theme and that it was obvious on the screen. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Observation 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        Intentionally, I wanted the user to have some sort <br>
                        of feedback when they hover over an interactive element. <br>
                        I understand that my approach may not be the <br>
                        best approach to having some sort of user interaction, <br>
                        but it is still a form of interactive feedback to <br>
                        the user. It was suggested that I up scaled the <br>
                        cherry blossom image a bit more when hovering over <br>
                        it, but I believe that the way I designed it will <br>
                        not allow me to do that so easily. With the images, <br>
                        I believe that they were distorted because of meeting <br>
                        the image requirement of keeping images under 200KB. <br>
                        That is why I had to compress the image and lower <br>
                        the quality to meet these conditions. I also did <br>
                        not really figure out how to unstretch the image.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Observation 3</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was a pretty straightforward question to ask about <br>
                        the sound and if it really made any big difference <br>
                        to the experience. What the user said is that <br>
                        it added a nice atmospheric touch to the website <br>
                        but it was unclear what it's purpose was <br>
                        until the user clicked on the play button. <br>
                        The user seemed to have needed to click the <br>
                        sound before the user realized what it was <br>
                        for. What I had intended here was that the sound <br>
                        be played automatically and have cherry blossoms <br>
                        fly across the screen to simulate something <br>
                        blowing in the wind. This was something I want <br>
                        the user to experience when they enter the site. <br>
                        To have something similar to a windy, outside experience.
