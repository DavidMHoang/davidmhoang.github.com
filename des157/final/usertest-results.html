                        User response: I don’t see anything “following” when <br>
                        I scroll. I am not sure what I am <br>
                        supposed to be looking for. I am not sure <br>
                        if it’s a good idea or not because I <br>
                        am not sure what is supposed to be following? <br>
                        Is there supposed to be a sticky element or <br>
                        a fixed element? I like the concept of a <br>
                        website that is a cherry blossom tree with blossoms <br>
                        being the clickable elements though.

                        User response: When hovering over the blossom <br>
                        icons some descriptive text appear describing what <br>
                        I will see when I click. I like this as a <br>
                        way of communicating that the blossom is clickable <br>
                        but it would be nice if the blossom also <br>
                        scaled up a bit; like scale: 1.1 on hover <br>
                        would be nice to better communicate the interactivity. <br>
                        I also would have liked to see non-distorted images. <br>
                        The stretching of the photos makes them a lot <br>
                        less pleasing to look at than if they were a <br>
                        bit smaller but not stretched.

                        User response: The sound added a nice atmospheric touch, <br>
                        but it was unclear what it’s purpose was until <br>
                        I clicked on it. Then I was like, “ah okay, <br>
                        it’s atmospheric.” Something to indicate the <br>
                        purpose of the sound to the user would have <br>
                        been nice so I could decide whether I want to <br>
                        click before I click.
