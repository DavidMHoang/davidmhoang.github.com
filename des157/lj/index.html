            When first reading the article, I thought to myself, <br>
            "the information was going to be redundant to me <br>
            and that everything I was about to read what <br>
            was already common sense." However, the more I read, <br>
            the more I realized that I made many of <br>
            these mistakes in the past when trying to create <br>
            a website. For example, when it comes to labels, <br>
            I always thought that inline labels would help assist <br>
            the user when entering texts into the input label <br>
            with examples of what should be in the input <br>
            label. The same concept applies to placeholder texts where <br>
            an example could be placed in there too. I <br>
            also thought that it would be exceptional to keep <br>
            the size fields all the same to keep it <br>
            nice and neat but it is much more preferred <br>
            to resize it accordingly. Dropdown menus I personally thought <br>
            were very neat to have too but minimizing the <br>
            use of it is the best option here. Overall, <br>
            the article was very interesting to read and very <br>
            insightful, helping me see things better with an open <br>
            mind!
