            When first reading the article, I thought to myself, "the information was going to be redundant to me and that everything I was about to read what was already common sense."
            However, the more I read, the more I realized that I made many of these mistakes in the past when trying to create a website. For example, when it comes to labels, I always 
            thought that inline labels would help assist the user when entering texts into the input label with examples of what should be in the input label. The same concept applies to 
            placeholder texts where an example could be placed in there too. I also thought that it would be exceptional to keep the size fields all the same to keep it nice and neat but 
            it is much more preferred to resize it accordingly. Dropdown menus I personally thought were very neat to have too but minimizing the use of it is the best option here. Overall, 
            the article was very interesting to read and very insgihtful, helping me see things better with an open mind!
