                    Reading this article, it helped me think of <br>
                    how I can implement this into the project <br>
                    that I am currently working on right now. <br>
                    I agree that applications or webpages should <br>
                    grab the user's attention so they will interact <br>
                    with it more. Having an interactive window would be <br>
                    very pleasing to the eyes and it being colorful <br>
                    would have more of an impact gaining attention. <br>
                    Using a focusing method and initiating the user <br>
                    to interact with input is a way to initiate <br>
                    a form of interaction, giving control to the user. <br>
                    Reading further on Modal, I found helpful information <br>
                    for the usage on mobile application, which benefits my <br>
                    resource searching for solutions to building my mobile app. <br>
                    I believe sizing and location on the screen is <br>
                    very important so it will make it blatantly obvious <br>
                    that this window upfront is meaningful or important. <br>
                    Having an escape hatch and a good, descriptive <br>
                    title makes it easier for the user to read. <br>
                    Overall, the idea of having a modal popup <br>
                    makes a page or app fun by interacting with <br>
                    the user and keeping them engaged with the screen.

                    When first reading the article, I thought to myself, <br>
                    "the information was going to be redundant to me <br>
                    and that everything I was about to read what <br>
                    was already common sense." However, the more I read, <br>
                    the more I realized that I made many of <br>
                    these mistakes in the past when trying to create <br>
                    a website. For example, when it comes to labels, <br>
                    I always thought that inline labels would help assist <br>
                    the user when entering texts into the input label <br>
                    with examples of what should be in the input <br>
                    label. The same concept applies to placeholder texts where <br>
                    an example could be placed in there too. I <br>
                    also thought that it would be exceptional to keep <br>
                    the size fields all the same to keep it <br>
                    nice and neat but it is much more preferred <br>
                    to resize it accordingly. Dropdown menus I personally thought <br>
                    were very neat to have too but minimizing the <br>
                    use of it is the best option here. Overall, <br>
                    the article was very interesting to read and very <br>
                    insightful, helping me see things better with an open <br>
                    mind!
