                    The image that is displayed above is one of the <br>
                    images I am excited to talk about. It is <br>
                    interesting because it takes both games and aesthetic scenery <br>
                    and combines the two to represent my thoughts for <br>
                    the images project. It relates to my topic by <br>
                    having the scenery and minecraft, a sandbox like videogame. <br>
                    My collection/archive is not complete (yet), but when it <br>
                    is finished, it will be able to explain who <br>
                    I am and say something about my story and <br>
                    my background. I do plan to mention personal background <br>
                    for further explanation and understanding of me, so others <br>
                    have an idea of who I am as a person. <br>
                    I hope that I am able to execute this <br>
                    project the way I envision it, and to portray <br>
                    a somewhat blinking, transition type effect and <br>
                    catch the attention of the reader and blow them away.

                    If by the time whoever reads this and the <br>
                    is not displayed above, I lost the image and <br>
                    requested it again from my partner, then I will <br>
                    update the image when received. I do remember it. <br>
                    I am not so sure what the image is <br>
                    about. It is very interesting and fascinating because I <br>
                    love cats, and interesting because the cat is in <br>
                    a suitcase, just relaxing, in a room. The most <br>
                    obvious aspects of the image is a cat and <br>
                    suitcase, however the most mysterious aspect of it is <br>
                    why is it in the suitcase? I can not  <br>
                    understand or interpret what is going on there. <br>
                    I assume that the image tells a story about<br>
                    how the cat travels with the owner wherever they <br>
                    go. I do hope to learn more about it <br>
                    and understand the story about it from the project!

                    Reading the article of 10 intriguing photograhs was inspiring. <br>
                    Seeing the photos, thinking to myself, and reading responses <br>
                    helped me understand the photos better and come up <br>
                    with different ideas and perspectives to understand them better. <br>
                    Looking at the photos and critically analyzing them to <br>
                    theorize a concept or idea keeps the brain occupied. <br>
                    I especially liked the idea of building on other's <br>
                    observations because it gives you a different perspective. <br>
                    Looking into a website that is visually appealing, <br>
                    I came across this website called <a href="https://bluehamham.com>">Blue Hamham</a> <br>
                    and it is one of the most interactive and <br>
                    cutest websites I have seen put together. One of <br>
                    my favorite features on it is the scrolling to <br>
                    interact and read onward, as well as the smooth <br>
                    transitions to the next panel of the website without refreshing. <br>
                    Scrolling to the second or third windowview gives amazing <br>
                    graphics and images for the other windows. I also really <br>
                    love the simplistic colors. This is the website I <br>
                    would get my inspiration from. It intrigues me, especially <br>
                    the parallaxing concept on the <a href="https://bluehamham.com>">"Who We Are"</a> page. <br>
                    Overall, I can continue on and on about what I like <br>
                    about this website, but regardless, the usage of <br>
                    images and keeping users, such as myself, focused and <br>
                    interested with colors, photos, graphics, and interactive components <br>
                    is a great website and overlays and transitions to <br>
                    new pages are spot on perfect!

                    Reading this article, it helped me think of <br>
                    how I can implement this into the project <br>
                    that I am currently working on right now. <br>
                    I agree that applications or webpages should <br>
                    grab the user's attention so they will interact <br>
                    with it more. Having an interactive window would be <br>
                    very pleasing to the eyes and it being colorful <br>
                    would have more of an impact gaining attention. <br>
                    Using a focusing method and initiating the user <br>
                    to interact with input is a way to initiate <br>
                    a form of interaction, giving control to the user. <br>
                    Reading further on Modal, I found helpful information <br>
                    for the usage on mobile application, which benefits my <br>
                    resource searching for solutions to building my mobile app. <br>
                    I believe sizing and location on the screen is <br>
                    very important so it will make it blatantly obvious <br>
                    that this window upfront is meaningful or important. <br>
                    Having an escape hatch and a good, descriptive <br>
                    title makes it easier for the user to read. <br>
                    Overall, the idea of having a modal popup <br>
                    makes a page or app fun by interacting with <br>
                    the user and keeping them engaged with the screen.

                    When first reading the article, I thought to myself, <br>
                    "the information was going to be redundant to me <br>
                    and that everything I was about to read what <br>
                    was already common sense." However, the more I read, <br>
                    the more I realized that I made many of <br>
                    these mistakes in the past when trying to create <br>
                    a website. For example, when it comes to labels, <br>
                    I always thought that inline labels would help assist <br>
                    the user when entering texts into the input label <br>
                    with examples of what should be in the input <br>
                    label. The same concept applies to placeholder texts where <br>
                    an example could be placed in there too. I <br>
                    also thought that it would be exceptional to keep <br>
                    the size fields all the same to keep it <br>
                    nice and neat but it is much more preferred <br>
                    to resize it accordingly. Dropdown menus I personally thought <br>
                    were very neat to have too but minimizing the <br>
                    use of it is the best option here. Overall, <br>
                    the article was very interesting to read and very <br>
                    insightful, helping me see things better with an open <br>
                    mind!
